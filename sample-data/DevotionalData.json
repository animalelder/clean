Yes!  He certainly does.  I tell men all the time that God speaks to you differently in marriage then when you are not married.  God blesses this institution when it operates under his perfect law of liberty.  The marriage itself provides a good life, but what you did not anticipate is that God also favors it.

During Adam\u2019s task to name all the animals, Adam saw the animals were made in pairs. He already knew what male and female were.  He could tell he had no counterpart. When God presented Eve to Adam, Adam cried out “this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone”. He immediately knew that this woman was his counterpart.\n In today\u2019s chapter, through Malachi, God tells us the purpose of marriage but not until he reconfirms that it was HE that made marriage in the first place.  Man did not make marriage no matter the myriad of ways we choose to prepare the wedding ceremony.  So if God made marriage, is it not His right to also tell us the purpose of the marriage?!?  Malachi writes clearly that the purpose of marriage is to bring forth children of God or holy seeds.  In other words, marriage is meant for not only procreation so that the human race can continue on, but it is also meant to raise and establish children that know and follow God!  Marriage was not created for your own personal happiness.  It can provide that too, but God has a bigger plan in mind.  And if you return to the story of the first sin, you may also remember that it is the holy seed that will eventually crush the head of Satan.\n But don\u2019t miss the first part of the passage that hearkens back to 1 Peter 3:7 which says that if you do not treat your wife with honor, that God will not hear your prayers.",

You thought that when you got married that every sexual need that you could ever have imagined would be right at your fingertips day and night.  You thought that you would never have to chase sex again.  You have a beautiful wife, so your days of finding ways to meet your sexual needs are now long over.\nWhat you didn\u2019t realize is that your wife is a thinking, breathing, human being that has needs and wants too.  She has to be happy and cared for and taken care of and… and… and… to be available for you to have sex with.  Now you are realizing that this marriage thing to meet your sexual needs is not what it was cracked up to be.  Why didn\u2019t someone tell you this before you entered this union?\nMy brother, don\u2019t worry, this is bigger than you.  This is my challenge.  Make up your mind to meet all of your sexual needs through your wife.  Period.  No if ands or buts.  Just do it.  This will change everything.  Your wife is upset and you would rather sneak a few minutes of pornography in the bathroom.  Nope!  Turn back around and make it right.  Another woman is showing you the respect that you feel you deserve, so maybe if I make her my wife for the night. Nope!  Turn around and have a conversation with your covenant wife.  You can\u2019t bother to meet her needs tonight.  You just want to get off quick and go to sleep.  Maybe I can think about a sexual experience with another woman from my past and get off.  Nope!  Get back to reality and get that need met through your wife.\nIf you are married, your first step to fully connecting to God is to fully connect with your wife.  There is no way around it.  Your wife is the entryway to developing your relationship with your heavenly father.  Trust me on this: This step is a necessity during this journey to sexual obedience.  It starts here but it doesn\u2019t end here.",

    "devotionText": "My brother, I gave you a big challenge yesterday!  Let me now tell you more about the battle that you are engaged in.  And really this is the ultimate versus battle for every man born in the flesh.  This battle is one of the flesh against the Spirit.  These two entities are literally complete opposites in every way.   And honestly they can\u2019t occupy the same space at the same time.  If you are feeding one, you are in turn starving the other.  It is as simple as that.\nThis is what you have to understand today.  You have to be aware of which of these two you are feeding.  In your daily activity, are you feeding the flesh or are you feeding the Spirit?  On the one hand, reread the works of the flesh as described by Paul: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, reveleries.  Think about your daily being and reflect on these works.  Christ said that you can know the tree by the fruit that it produces.   The works of the flesh are all selfish in nature.\nOn the other hand, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.   Did you notice that Paul described the works of the flesh in the plural, but the fruit of the spirit in singular?  The fruit of the spirit is like a multifaceted diamond.  This is the single character of the Spirit which can shine in different ways depending on where the light is reflected, but the whole still remains the same.  In other words, the fruit of the mango can be juicy, rich and sweet in the same bite.  So the fruit of the Spirit can have all these characteristics at the same time.\nTo win this battle against flesh, you have to at the very least feed the Spirit more than the flesh.  Most Christians feed the Spirit for 1-hour per week in Church but the other 167-hours in the week, they feed the flesh. This won\u2019t work in this fight for sexual obedience.  I hear you asking yourself: how do you feed the Spirit?  You feed the Spirit through reading the Word of God, prayer, fasting. You feed the Spirit through praise and worship. You feed the spirit by loving God and loving your neighbor.  The fruit of the Spirit is ultimately found full through your selflessness.",

Against such there is no law. And those who are Christ\u2019s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."

    "devotionText": "My brother, in the beginning God created male and female.  If you are familiar with the book of Genesis chapter 2 verse 24, the inspired writer of the book Moses, after Adam meets Eve for the first time, comments, “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”  This is obviously a commentary from the writer because neither Adam nor Eve had a fleshly father or mother since they were the first human beings created by God.  However, Moses pointed out that man and woman were meant to become united as one flesh.  And Jesus reverberated these words in the Book of Matthew in today\u2019s scripture in answering the Pharisees question about divorce..\nThe physical act of sexual intercourse is the uniting of male and female.  In other words, sexual intercourse is marriage under God\u2019s law. It is a blood covenant. The first sexual act for a woman breaks the hymen and this breaking releases blood signifying marriage between man and woman. The man, at the time of Abraham, had to be circumcised which also caused the shedding of blood as a symbol of his covenant or marriage to God. This blood covenant is not to be broken once male and female have been joined together.  Marriage is a covenant institution, and that covenant is established through sexual intercourse.  (If you explore further, the breaking of this covenant can only happen when one partner has sex with another person outside of marriage through sexual immoratlity committing adultery. Sex can be both part of the joining together and the separation of a marriage.)\nSimply put, sex is the basis of marriage, and is the singular, healthy way man and woman are to be united. This is how the lives of male and female are knit together.  And because it is under God, this bond is spiritual, as much as it is physical.The one flesh is a coming together of mind, body and soul.  Many refer to marriage as a holy covenant when done according to God\u2019s law. Colloquially, some also call it a soul tie.",

Actually, I am not a virgin many times over.  Paul says since our bodies are owned by Christ that we should never unite those bodies with a prostitute.  In this case, a prostitute refers to someone that is not our wife.  But Paul further states that if we do unite our body with a prostitute that we become one flesh with that prostitute.  Paul makes it clear that the principle of bonding between male and female happens when sexual intercourse occurs.  And he makes it plain that we cannot choose who we become one body with when sex is involved.  When we choose sex, we also as a consequence, whether intended or not, become bonded with that partner.  Becoming one flesh with different women through sex is sexual immorality.  And every woman that we have sex also creates a bond with that woman.  This is the case whether it is a girlfriend from our past that we had a long relationship with to a one night stand after a party, or literally a paid encounter with a prostitute.  These covenants that we made where the intention was not marriage, but our own pleasure are called unholy covenants and represent unhealthy bonding. And it is these types of covenants that open the door to the enemy.\nThese bonds can easily be validated in the mind.  Have you ever been out somewhere familiar and that place triggered a memory of a woman that you have been with sexually in the past?  Or has a sexual event from your past appeared to your mind visually out of nowhere?  Or have you ever had a dream where you were taken back to a moment with a woman from your past or a woman that you have lusted after?",

Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, \"The two will become one flesh.\" But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price.

I realized that every woman that I had sex with actually put distance between me and God.  Actually God is the immovable object, but we, ourselves, pull farther away.  Do you want to really draw closer to God?  An important part of that directional move is to offer your body as a living sacrifice to Him.  Submit your members (your penis) to Him, and use it only under the parameters that he deemed holy and pleasing to Him.\nLet’s also broaden the idea of sex by using a snippet from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount which preached, “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’  But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ” (Matthew 5:27-28 NKJV).  Furthermore, Job 31:1-4 (MSG) says, “I made a solemn pact with myself never to undress a girl with my eyes. So what can I expect from God? What do I deserve from God Almighty above?  Isn’t calamity reserved for the wicked? Isn’t disaster supposed to strike those who do wrong? Isn’t God looking, observing how I live? Doesn’t he mark every step I take?” Both make it clear that while the sin is full grown under the act of fornication or adultery, sexual sin is first conceived at the point of lust.  Ask David what happened when he saw Bathsheba bathing on that rooftop! To be thorough, I want you to conclude that everything from lust of the eyes to the physical act of sexual intercourse, and every sexual encounter that falls short of intercourse should be included in unhealthy bonding.  This includes but is not limited to lusting after a woman that you could not have sex with, receiving or giving oral sex, engaging in pornography, frequenting strip clubs, being molested, having sex with a woman whose name that you cannot remember, and having sex with women whose names you can remember.\nOne topic that comes up consistently is to or not to masturbate.  Let me add this for those who need an extra push.  You are right, the topic of masturbation cannot be found anywhere in the Bible.  The closest we have is the Onan, the son of Judah, spilling his seed on the ground because he did not want to have children with Tamar.  Because of this lack of mention of masturbation as sin in the Bible, some men have argued that it is ok to masturbate.  So let us say that you are able to masturbate without the help of a physical interaction with a woman that is not your wife, without the help of pornography, or without the help of fantasizing about a woman, have you ever been able to masturbate and pray to your God thereafter? No.  And that is because masturbation alone brings shame and causes you to hide from God.  Anything that causes you to turn from God in your life should be avoided.",

This is the way that God designed it.\nFinally, this prayer is short so you can do it anywhere and everywhere.

Be obedient and break those soul ties as they come to your remembrance.  Do not relish in the past, just release it in Jesus’ name.\nOne thing that I have experienced personally and have heard through the testimonies of many of the brothers like you who have moved through the Clean process is attacks in the dream state.  You may have already experienced this prior to Clean.  While sleeping, you may experience a dream where you are offered sex or find yourself in a sexually compromising situation.  Young boys colloquially called these wet dreams.  They are similar, but in order to clear up the misunderstanding around these types of dreams, let me explain.  This temptation is not from God.  These dreams are demonic attacks from the enemy and one must resist them.  I know, this is weird, and this might be the first time you are hearing about something like this.  I get it.  But listen.  Through the breaking of soul ties, you are cleaning up your past through the cleansing blood of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  And this act in and of itself is going to alert the enemy.  You were complicit in sexual disobedience, and the enemy is trying to make sure that he doesn’t lose one of his best members.\nThe key is that the fight against sexual disobedience must not only happen in the physical realm, but all seeds must be killed at the conception stage wherever they appear, including the dream state.  You have to fight the enemy on all levels.  If you are faced with a sexual proposition in your dream, you say no!  You resist, You run.  You get out of there.  And if worse comes to worse and you find yourself succumbing to the proposition then you WAKE UP!  There is no shame in that.  And even if you do fall during the dream, you pray, you repent, and you fight again the next time.  Don’t give up!    And finally, if you experience sleep paralysis or torment or any other demonic attack, you cry out--whether audibly or inaudibly--the name Jesus Christ.  The name above every name will set you free.\nAnd remember “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13)",

    "devotionText": "My brother, I get it.  You are married or waiting faithfully to be married and you are relying on your wife for all of your needs.  But sometimes, you need something a little different to get that release.  The two most popular releases today are strip clubs and pornography.  It is harmless right?  There is no physical connection, so no possibility to really hurt anyone.\n This is where the scripture from Hosea comes in.  (And honestly, if you are familiar with the Prophet Books in the Old Testament, you are then well aware that God constantly uses the metaphor of adultery when His children seek other Gods.  This confirms the importance of loyalty in marriage to God.)  Look at what God says in this scripture, he is not going to go after the whoring daughters or adulterous wives but the men.  Tough love right?!  Yea.  Unfair right?! Probably.  But God’s order? Certainly.  You know you are the head of the household whether you have a wife and children yet or not.  God is preparing you to serve Him and his provided you with a call-first responsibility.  When Adam and Eve were hiding in those bushes, who did he call first although Eve was equally guilty of the first sin?  He called Adam.\n One day it occurred to me that the worship at the holy whorehouses described in Hosea symbolized today’s strip clubs.  At least back in Hosea’s day, the people worshipped under the auspices of fertility needs.  Though still a no no from God’s perspective.  Men do not have fertility in mind today, just personal pleasure--spilling their seed in some way.  The worship house gets the right rhythm going and lights turned down for the clothesless praise dance.  The feminine goddess who entertains you (or is it who you entertain) is naked and does a praise dance around a metal pole to get you erect.  You prepare your offering through tithes for her good work.  And you lay those tithes on the altar where her dance takes place.  Maybe you pay her extra for a personal one-on-one consultation.  You have specific needs right?!  For a moment, you submit and worship her.   You entertain this goddess that you placed on that pedestal and worship her.  Let’s not confuse the obvious: this is worship at the holy whorehouse, I mean, the stripclub.",

    "devotionText": "My brother, I get it.  You don’t believe in curses even if described by God in His own words by His own finger.  Let me give you an abbreviated example of how a family cursed played out in scripture several generations after the Ten Commandments were introduced.\n Saul, selected and anointed by God through the Prophet Samuel, was crowned the first king of Israel.  Early on in Saul’s kingship, God commanded Saul to destroy the Amalekites, including people, animals and riches. No remnants of the Amalekites should remain.  (The reason for this command from God is rooted in the Amalekites attack on the children of Israel during the days of Moses.)  Saul failed to be obedient to God.  God then promised to rip the kingdom from Saul and his family.  This disobedience was the beginning of a generational curse.\n Saul later lost his own life and the lives of his three sons--Jonathan, Abinidab, and Malchishua (from his covenant wife) in a single day during a battle against the Philistines.  Ishobeth his son from a concubine rose to kinship over Israel but lost his life in an assasination attempt.  One of Saul’s daughters Michal was married to David, but because of an irreconcilable disagreement with David, Michal never bore any of David’s (many) children.  Merab (from Saul’s covenant wife) and Aiah (from Saul’s concubine) had 7 sons between them.  Now, Saul tried to wipe out the Gibeonites in what appears to have been a despicable act.  Long after Saul’s death, the Gibeonites asked David for retribution.  Because of this, all 7 sons of Merab and Aiah were hanged by the Gibeonites in retribution.  The sole survivor from the branch of Saul was Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan.  However, Mephibosheth when he was still a boy was dropped by his caregiver and left lame in both his legs all of his life.  Because of the promise made between David and Jonthan, David ultimately took Mephibosheth into his household, the father of Mephibosheth.  Through this sole survivor, the line of Saul was shown mercy by God.  It took 3-4 generations after Mephibosheth for the branch to be restored.  Later on these descendants were described as a group of valiant men.  Still, the curse vetted out against the family of Saul, because of Saul’s disobedience, gets played out across several decades until every child of Saul was accounted for by God.\n My brother, you are fighting for your success despite the sins of your parents.  You are fighting for the success of your offspring.  The blessing in both of today’s scriptures is that you do not have to suffer for the sins of your father if you choose to go the way of obedience toward God.",

I soon came to realize that the 3-4 generations refer to those generations that are living during your lifetime.

    "devotionText": "My brother, David’s victory over Goliath was a pivotal moment in not only the life of David but of all of Israel as well.  It took several chapters in the book of 1 Samuel to give the complete back story leading up to the fateful match, a detailed description of the victory of David over Goliath, and the follow up response to that victory.   I would conservatively say at least 1 Samuel 15-18 would give you everything that you need to understand this story.  Now, think about that, it took 4 chapters, at least, to describe the defeat of this single giant in the lives of David and the children of Israel.  This moment though changed the ENTIRE culture of Israel and set the next generation on a new path.\n The second half of 2 Samuel 21:15-22 - the writer describes the 4 children of the giant at Gath (aka Goliath) that were later killed.  The first giant actually almost killed David himself.  This was an older David, and maybe one that should not still be on the battlefield.  The light of Israel, David, was almost extinguished before Abishai, his nephew and armor bearer, jumps in to kill the giant. The second giant was killed by one of David’s mighty men whose victory was described only in a single sentence. The third giant who was also mentioned as Goliath’s brother was killed by another of David’s mighty men in yet another short sentence.  In full circle, the fourth giant was killed by Jonathan the son of Shimea.  Jonathan is the nephew of David.  Shimea, David’s brother, was both there when Goliath taunted all of Israel for 40 days, and witnessed when David killed Goliath as a boy.\n This passage of scripture reminds us that the giant you kill today is still a giant that your children will face tomorrow.  However, the difference is: your children will face that giant and defeat it.  In your story, like David’s, this giant was the main character.  In your children’s story, with God’s help, it will only be a footnote.  Keep fighting brothers!",

But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to his aid, and struck the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore to him, saying, “You shall go out no more with us to battle, lest you quench the lamp of Israel.”Now it happened afterward that there was again a battle with the Philistines at Gob. Then Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who was one of the sons of ]the giant. Again there was war at Gob with the Philistines, where Elhanan the son of Jaare-Oregim the Bethlehemite killed the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. Yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was born to the giant.So when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him. These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants."

As soon as you began to pray, a word went out, which I have come to tell you, for you are highly esteemed. Therefore, consider the word and understand the vision..."

    "devotionText": "These devotional and commentaries are not reading the Word.  Your Pastor preaching is not reading the Word (even if the graphics are fancy).  Your daily email with one or two verses pulled by an algorithm from your daily app is not reading the Word.  These are all supplements to the actual reading of the Word of God.   And you can’t live off of supplements.  Even Jesus Christ said that “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.”  Even the vitamin bottle full of supplements says to digest with food!  And the Bible is that food.  Everything else, commentaries, devotionals, and preaching are supplements.  If you ate supplements only, even if they have vitamins, you would be malnourished.  Supplements are a good start, but they are not enough for you to live off of, and this reason why I nudge (well maybe push) you to read the Bible itself.  And the Holy Spirit talks to you specifically through the Bible.   If you don’t read it, you miss this important mode of communication in your life as a follower of Christ.\n Ezekiel says he ate the scroll and it tasted like honey.  The scroll is the Word of God.  And you have to pick it up and read it for yourself.  Ask the Holy Spirit for insight, for guidance.  Make a plan and push yourself to read through the entire book in a year.  Get in a group with other brothers if you have to.  If you read about 3 chapters a day, every day, you will be able to read the Word in a year!  Take more time if you need to, but get through it.  You don’t have to understand everything.  Hebrews 4:12 says that the Word of God is living and powerful.  This means that while the Word stays the same, you are different every time that you read it.  This difference provides you different insights.  The Holy Spirit ultimately uses your reading of the Word to transform you.\nMy last intermediate concession is for you to listen to the Word.  Let it play and soak it in as a concession.  But read the Word everyday no matter what.  Meditate on it day and night.  This is how God speaks with you.  The Word is your sword of truth.  Get armed.",

    "devotionText": "My brother, prayer is a combination of petitioning and commanding, and listening.  You must listen.  You have to be still, to let that still small voice speak to you.  And He will.  The voice is not going to talk over you.  It is gentle.  It is soft.  But it is willing to guide you if you let it.  The Holy Spirit may also urge you to pray, or what to pray, or who to pray for.  This direction comes from listening and obeying.\nPrayer is also transformative.  The first scripture tells you first to humble yourself so that you can pray.  Do you come humbly before the God of the universe before you begin to pray.  Do you remember how Jesus taught the disciples how they should pray.  Do you begin with the majesty of God?  Our Father, who art in Heaven.  Hallowed be your name.  Do you ask to be forgiven for your sins so God can actually hear your prayer?  Do you forgive those who sinned against you before you ask God for such a bold request?  God says that if we come to him humbly, if we pray, if we seek His face, and if we turn from our wickedness, only then will he hear us, forgive our sins, and heal us.  One thing that you should have received up until this point: prayer is critical to the transformation that we seek.  The prayer doesn’t have to be fancy, but it has to be sincere.  It doesn’t have to be long, but it should be specific.  Prayer is a lifeline provided to us by our creator, I pray that you use it.\nMark 9:29 says that some things can only come out by prayer and fasting.  I found that this spirit of lust can only be broken through fasting.  You are going to need God working on your behalf to break this stronghold over your life.  I know, you may not know much about fasting.  Fasting is the third critical tool in the life of Clean along with the Word of God, and prayer.",

    "devotionText": "My brother, this is what we have been gearing up for--the corporal fast.  I don’t know if you have fasted before or not. If you have, then I encourage you to push yourself a little on this one.  If you haven’t fasted, this might be one of the most important experiences of your Christian life.  Christ says “when we fast…” (Matthew 6:16-18). He does not if we fast. Fasting is an essential part of Christian faith. Now there are different types of fast that you can choose from. I am not the Christian fasting police, but I strongly recommended choosing from one of the following: the Daniel fast, a juice fast, or a water fast. In my opinion, this is where you want to grow into in your Christian journey, even if it is not where you are now.\nThe Daniel fast (Daniel 1:11-16) has many variations but the most common is no meat or processed foods including sugar and some say breads as well.  The easiest way to think about it is as a true vegetarian diet without any processed foods.  The juice fast is fresh pressed juice only during the fast.  A common way is with a juicer (not a blender) at home or the simplest way is to purchase a set of juices from a juice location.  (Although some have done a smoothie fast!)  The most challenging fast is the water fast (or is it Esther’s no food or drink fast!).  The water fast is the simplest (and cheapest).  I leave it up to you to choose among these three.  But the goal in your choice is to choose something that makes you dependent on God.  Try Him.  He will sustain you.\nThe unsaid given of the fast is how you deal with the outside world during this time.  While fasting, it is a given to remain in God’s presence to the extent that you can.  If you want to listen to something, listen to gospel.  If you want to watch something, pull up a favorite sermon or pastor.  If you want to read something, read the Word or some book centered on Christ.  If you are hungry, pray.  If you are thirsty, pray.  You will be surprised how feeding the Holy Spirit in these various ways actually kills any hunger pains.  This is how the Spirit gets fed.  The goal of the fast is to starve the flesh, so the Spirit can get stronger in you.  It is this Spirit that we need to break yokes and heal us.\nThe fast that I want you to undergo is a three-day fast of your choosing starting the evening of Day 4 until the evening of Day 7.  The fast is an extended prayer.  In this case, it would be the equivalent of praying to God for three straight days.  If you know the story of Esther, she called this fast of all the Jews because she was about to go to the King with an impossible request.  And she wanted God on her side for it.  You are also going to your King Jesus Christ with an impossible request.  If you are in the will of Christ, He will answer you.  If only you would listen!\nIf you are part of a Clean group, then you will go on this fast in agreement with other men chasing after God.  We are not only praying for ourselves, but for each other during this time.  James 5:16 says “Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed.  The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.” If you want to know more about the type of fasting that pleases God, refer to Isaiah 58.",

If you meet at 7pm on Sunday for instance, then your fast should ideally begin together at 7pm on Thursday.  If you are able, you should kick off the fast in testimony and corporal prayer at the beginning of your fast.\nMy brother, let us spend the first evening of the fast alone continuing our prayers against unholy covenants and soul ties.  Remind our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ of your intention to break these yokes!  Remind Him of all the work that you have already done in these past 3 weeks preparing for this final call.  Ask the Holy Spirit to bring any more unholy covenants to your remembrance.  Pray against those soul ties.  Ask God to break these strongholds in your life.  Let Him know that you want to strengthen your marital bond.  Let God know that you want to find your covenant wife.  Let Him know that you don’t know if you are ready, but you want to be.  And it is through Him with all the power and the glory that you can be made ready.\nGod has plans to prosper you and not to harm you.   This is refinement.  It is challenging.  It may be painful.

Have you been listening?  Have you been observant to all things around you?  God is going to use everything and anything to get your attention.  He will speak to you in the way that you need to hear.  Are you paying attention?  What is the Spirit telling you to pray?\nIf you get hungry, remember that the Lord will satisfy your soul.  If you are weak, let God know.  Call out to Him to feed your spirit.  Let him know that the Spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.  Let God know that these sins are behind you.  That you are charting a new path under His light.  That He will now be a lamp to your feet moving forward.  Let God know how much you need Him, and there will be no continuing without Him.  Pray that God breaks these yokes that are obstacles between you and Him.  Pray that God continues to reveal those yokes that you do not know about.  Let God be a strength to your bones.  Let God be like a spring that never fails in your life.\nBut lastly, listen to God and what he is saying and revealing to you.  This only works if you obey.  Disobedience is a sin.  God wants you to obey Him.  Do what he tells you however difficult it may be, so you can be truly free.  Forgive that family member.  Confess that transgression.  Pray for that enemy.  Do what is required.\nIn my experience, during a fast like this one, the enemy may make a strike against you.  When your flesh is weak is when the enemy will test you.  Submit to God.  Resist the Devil and he will flee from you.  All you have to do is obey God and resist the enemy’s temptation.  God always makes a way for escape in EVERY temptation.  1 Corinthinians says “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.”  The Devil can only tempt you.  He cannot make you do anything that you are unwilling to do.\n",

For it is written: “‘He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.’” Jesus answered him, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’” Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. “All this I will give you,” he said, “if you will bow down and worship me.” Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan!

You can’t solve every problem that you have ever faced in this 3-day fast, but this fast--in addition to the Word and prayer--should have revealed to you that you can solve the problems of this world when you seek God in this way.\nToday is your last meeting with Clean, but the journey far from ends here. It is only the beginning. Continue to read the Word, pray and fast regularly. God wants you to call on Him. Jesus says that the three ways to seek Him are: “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

If you are unwilling to go forward and you can’t go back, then you may get stuck in the wilderness.\nMy brother, if you have gone this far, you may now realize that there is no turning back.  When the children of Israel were brought forth by God through Moses from Egypt, they were led into the wilderness.  At this point, they lamented about all that they missed back home in slavery.  They actually cried out to God to go back to Egypt!!!  They missed the food and the comforts of slavery.  If they knew freedom was going to be like this in the wilderness, they would have remained slaves.\nGod responded not by granting their desires, but by leading those original Israelites from Egypt around the wilderness like musical chairs until they all died out!  Maybe not all, a few men like Joshua got a chance to see all of the above, Egypt, the wilderness, and the Promised Land.  The majority weren’t ready to go forward to what God had for them, but God knew that going back was also not an option.\nClean is now over so the question that you must ask yourself honestly is will you put your hand to the plow and advance to what God has for you?

If you are like me, after going through Clean, there will be some things that will become more difficult to do.  For me, my ability to engage in media changed drastically.  Over time it became more difficult to watch certain television programs and movies.  I became more cautious about what I was spent time watching.  Beyond letting go of watching pornography, the world’s media is comprised of soft porn.  You would be hard pressed to watch an adult television series or movie that did not promote nudity and sexual content.  At first, I would continue to watch these shows, but would fast forward through sex scenes or scenes with sexual content.  Then, I began to watch shows that were more family friendly.  And soon, I would only watch shows once in a while instead of on a consistent basis.   The same things happened with music and books.  You may also rethink how you spend time pursuing personal pleasures, friendships and relationships.  I now guard more time.  I think more about the ways that I can spend feeding the spirit and doing the work of God.  This is important to keep in mind to remain trending toward deliverance.\nA few practical things that you can do include listening to a broader range of sermons, gospel music, and the audio Bible; subscribing to faith centered programming like Pureflix and the Chosen; reading Christ centered books on topics that would help to grow my faith.\n Whatever you choose, let the Holy Spirit convict you of sin. The Holy Spirit will point out things in your life that are not of Him.  He will convict you, if you listen and obey.

    "devotionText": "My brother, let me share this analogy with you regarding freewill.  Yes, we all have freewill… up to a point when it relates to the spiritual.  If you found yourself at a house party, and one of your friends took out some serious drugs for you to try.  You have the freewill to say no.  If he put it right in front of you, you could still say no.  If he put it right to your lips, you could still refuse.  But once you use your freewill to choose to take those drugs.  You have surrendered your freewill.  You are now subject to the will of the drugs.  This is how sin works.  Once you choose to sin, you open the door to the enemy and give that enemy license to operate in your life.  Even worse, if the door to a sin was opened in your family within your bloodline, the consequence of the sin can now operate in your life.  But don’t fall out yet.\nNow, what is important to understand is that the enemy does not bother you until you start to fight back.  Praying to be set free from soul ties and praying to be set free from generational curses starts a fight against the enemy.  Refusing to sin willfully starts a fight against the enemy.  Telling others about the glory of God starts a fight against the enemy.  You may just be understanding this, but your disobedience toward God was a form of obedience toward the enemy.  Hence, our covenant with the Devil. \nFreewill works the other way as well.  If you choose God, and call on the holy name of Jesus, you can break the covenant made with sin whether for your own sins or those operating in your family.  The cleansing blood of Jesus can cover any past sin.\nPaul goes further to imply that if you choose Jesus Christ that He will both impact your will for His good pleasure and for you to do for His good pleasure.  What does this mean?  It means that your only job is to be obedient to Christ, he will operate the other things for you.  He will operate your desire (purpose) toward Him and cause you to do (purpose) for Him.\nKeep fighting brothers!",

You take what he used to destroy you and put it on display for all to see.  Once you do that and you overcome it, then the enemy has nothing left to hold against you.  You think that sharing your testimony is about changing the lives of others facing your same challenges?  Yes, it does that too!  But really what it does is, it serves as a reminder of what God brought you through!  Every time you share it.  Every time you lift someone out of their predicament, God is glorified and you move farther from that sin that once had you in bondage.\nSo let the redeemed say so and let them declare how much God has done for them.  Sharing your testimony should begin easily with the brothers that you know.  And, you should grow confidently into sharing with brothers that you don’t know.  Your testimony is one part of the accountability process and keeping those chains broken.  Share freely and share widely.  The only thing that God cannot do for you is share your testimony.  That part is up to you.",

At the end of the group, I recommend that you stay in contact with your Right-Hand as well as the Group Facilitator for your Clean group.  These should be your brothers-in-arms moving forward, and the start of that threefold cord.  And like Solomon, this type of bond is not easily broken.  Maybe on your journey you will be able to pull other brothers up by sharing this group, serving as a Right-Hand, and/or leading as a Group Facilitator.\nI also suggest seeking out and joining other Christ-centered men’s groups.  Through Thirty Mighty Men Ministries, we created Bible Study groups in order to both keep brothers who have gone through Clean in the Word of God, and to invite any seeking man an opportunity to read the Word for themselves in group fellowship.  If you are reading this and you have completed Clean, then this is an invitation to join any Bible Study group that you can find or to join one of the Bible Study groups at 30MMM.  I advise you to check your church and/or the local churches in the area for small groups.\nYet and still, the ultimate accountability partner is really a friend, Jesus Christ, that sticks closer than a brother.",

    "devotionText": "If you fall, get back up and keep going with your fight against the sin.  You only fell because you were using your own willpower.  In willpower alone, the Devil let’s you mount you on proverbial horse, so you can fall.  Don’t let the Devil win.  The enemy’s job is to make you fall away from God.  You have to use sin to draw closer to God through repentance and forgiveness of yourself.  God may chastise you, but that is what a good father does.   But, He will forgive you, if you ask.  In my walk with God, I realized that Jesus Christ would have forgiven Judas, the man who it would have been better if he was never born, if He only asked.  If Christ would have forgiven Judas, then he can forgive me.\nBut not only that, you must forgive others of their trespasses against you. There is no need to hold that over others anymore. You have to forgive. God commands you to first reconcile with your brother or sister, before coming to Him with your offering.\nI found that Clean is just the beginning of the journey. All this time that we lived in sexual confusion and disobedience, we could not hear God’s verse as clearly as we can under self-control. With that, there are so many other things that God now wants to develop in us so that we can be more Christ. The good news is, in my opinion, there is nothing more difficult in your upcoming walk with God that will have been as difficult as this bout for sexual obedience. I am not saying that it is smooth sailing from here, but I do know, you now have the right tools on hand to take on any problem head on.  For if God be for us, who can be against us?",

    "devotionText": "My brother, this is the final devotion. If you made it all the way through, I pray that God touched you in a special way over these past few weeks. I know that He did!\nThis is what I learned ultimately about Clean.  Clean has little to do with a battle for sexual integrity, and everything to do with a spiritual battle against the Spirit of lust (or the flesh). Once I got Clean, through the development of the Holy Spirit, I noticed that other things that I used to pine over were also killed within me. That lust in me did not just fuel sexual perversion, but it also served as an unhealthy fuel in ambition, for greed, for discontent, etc. All these things that I thought were so important to my survival and livelihood--whether well intentioned or not--were no longer a necessity to me.  That house or car that I always wanted. Or the legacy that I wanted for my children and my children’s children.  I was surprised how easily I was able to let go of those things and chart a new path in my life with Christ at the center.\nI still remember one specific revelation where God distinctly told me that even if I built something to pass down to my children and their children, there was no guarantee that it would stand.  He reminded me in my Spirit that it was He that built the house, not me. And it was He that ensured that the house would stand for those who loved him and obeyed Him. The only legacy that I was required to give my children and their children was a love and understanding of God. The rest of it was up to Him. If I did this, He promised to uphold His end of the bargain. Psalm 127 captured the sentiment of that revelation with pinpoint accuracy, for me, illustrating the mercy of God in my life.\nThis revelation and numerous others were so clear to me as I continued on this journey.  Putting God first became so much clearer in my mind.  I pray that this journey fuels you to chase after God as never before.  God deserves your attention.  And you deserve this God.",
