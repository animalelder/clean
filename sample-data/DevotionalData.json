Yes!  He certainly does.  I tell men all the time that God speaks to you differently in marriage then when you are not married.  God blesses this institution when it operates under his perfect law of liberty.  The marriage itself provides a good life, but what you did not anticipate is that God also favors it.

During Adam\u2019s task to name all the animals, Adam saw the animals were made in pairs. He already knew what male and female were.  He could tell he had no counterpart. When God presented Eve to Adam, Adam cried out “this is flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone”. He immediately knew that this woman was his counterpart.\n In today\u2019s chapter, through Malachi, God tells us the purpose of marriage but not until he reconfirms that it was HE that made marriage in the first place.  Man did not make marriage no matter the myriad of ways we choose to prepare the wedding ceremony.  So if God made marriage, is it not His right to also tell us the purpose of the marriage?!?  Malachi writes clearly that the purpose of marriage is to bring forth children of God or holy seeds.  In other words, marriage is meant for not only procreation so that the human race can continue on, but it is also meant to raise and establish children that know and follow God!  Marriage was not created for your own personal happiness.  It can provide that too, but God has a bigger plan in mind.  And if you return to the story of the first sin, you may also remember that it is the holy seed that will eventually crush the head of Satan.\n But don\u2019t miss the first part of the passage that hearkens back to 1 Peter 3:7 which says that if you do not treat your wife with honor, that God will not hear your prayers.",

You thought that when you got married that every sexual need that you could ever have imagined would be right at your fingertips day and night.  You thought that you would never have to chase sex again.  You have a beautiful wife, so your days of finding ways to meet your sexual needs are now long over.\nWhat you didn\u2019t realize is that your wife is a thinking, breathing, human being that has needs and wants too.  She has to be happy and cared for and taken care of and… and… and… to be available for you to have sex with.  Now you are realizing that this marriage thing to meet your sexual needs is not what it was cracked up to be.  Why didn\u2019t someone tell you this before you entered this union?\nMy brother, don\u2019t worry, this is bigger than you.  This is my challenge.  Make up your mind to meet all of your sexual needs through your wife.  Period.  No if ands or buts.  Just do it.  This will change everything.  Your wife is upset and you would rather sneak a few minutes of pornography in the bathroom.  Nope!  Turn back around and make it right.  Another woman is showing you the respect that you feel you deserve, so maybe if I make her my wife for the night. Nope!  Turn around and have a conversation with your covenant wife.  You can\u2019t bother to meet her needs tonight.  You just want to get off quick and go to sleep.  Maybe I can think about a sexual experience with another woman from my past and get off.  Nope!  Get back to reality and get that need met through your wife.\nIf you are married, your first step to fully connecting to God is to fully connect with your wife.  There is no way around it.  Your wife is the entryway to developing your relationship with your heavenly father.  Trust me on this: This step is a necessity during this journey to sexual obedience.  It starts here but it doesn\u2019t end here.",

    "devotionText": "My brother, I gave you a big challenge yesterday!  Let me now tell you more about the battle that you are engaged in.  And really this is the ultimate versus battle for every man born in the flesh.  This battle is one of the flesh against the Spirit.  These two entities are literally complete opposites in every way.   And honestly they can\u2019t occupy the same space at the same time.  If you are feeding one, you are in turn starving the other.  It is as simple as that.\nThis is what you have to understand today.  You have to be aware of which of these two you are feeding.  In your daily activity, are you feeding the flesh or are you feeding the Spirit?  On the one hand, reread the works of the flesh as described by Paul: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, reveleries.  Think about your daily being and reflect on these works.  Christ said that you can know the tree by the fruit that it produces.   The works of the flesh are all selfish in nature.\nOn the other hand, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.   Did you notice that Paul described the works of the flesh in the plural, but the fruit of the spirit in singular?  The fruit of the spirit is like a multifaceted diamond.  This is the single character of the Spirit which can shine in different ways depending on where the light is reflected, but the whole still remains the same.  In other words, the fruit of the mango can be juicy, rich and sweet in the same bite.  So the fruit of the Spirit can have all these characteristics at the same time.\nTo win this battle against flesh, you have to at the very least feed the Spirit more than the flesh.  Most Christians feed the Spirit for 1-hour per week in Church but the other 167-hours in the week, they feed the flesh. This won\u2019t work in this fight for sexual obedience.  I hear you asking yourself: how do you feed the Spirit?  You feed the Spirit through reading the Word of God, prayer, fasting. You feed the Spirit through praise and worship. You feed the spirit by loving God and loving your neighbor.  The fruit of the Spirit is ultimately found full through your selflessness.",

Against such there is no law. And those who are Christ\u2019s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit."

    "devotionText": "My brother, in the beginning God created male and female.  If you are familiar with the book of Genesis chapter 2 verse 24, the inspired writer of the book Moses, after Adam meets Eve for the first time, comments, “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”  This is obviously a commentary from the writer because neither Adam nor Eve had a fleshly father or mother since they were the first human beings created by God.  However, Moses pointed out that man and woman were meant to become united as one flesh.  And Jesus reverberated these words in the Book of Matthew in today\u2019s scripture in answering the Pharisees question about divorce..\nThe physical act of sexual intercourse is the uniting of male and female.  In other words, sexual intercourse is marriage under God\u2019s law. It is a blood covenant. The first sexual act for a woman breaks the hymen and this breaking releases blood signifying marriage between man and woman. The man, at the time of Abraham, had to be circumcised which also caused the shedding of blood as a symbol of his covenant or marriage to God. This blood covenant is not to be broken once male and female have been joined together.  Marriage is a covenant institution, and that covenant is established through sexual intercourse.  (If you explore further, the breaking of this covenant can only happen when one partner has sex with another person outside of marriage through sexual immoratlity committing adultery. Sex can be both part of the joining together and the separation of a marriage.)\nSimply put, sex is the basis of marriage, and is the singular, healthy way man and woman are to be united. This is how the lives of male and female are knit together.  And because it is under God, this bond is spiritual, as much as it is physical.The one flesh is a coming together of mind, body and soul.  Many refer to marriage as a holy covenant when done according to God\u2019s law. Colloquially, some also call it a soul tie.",

Actually, I am not a virgin many times over.  Paul says since our bodies are owned by Christ that we should never unite those bodies with a prostitute.  In this case, a prostitute refers to someone that is not our wife.  But Paul further states that if we do unite our body with a prostitute that we become one flesh with that prostitute.  Paul makes it clear that the principle of bonding between male and female happens when sexual intercourse occurs.  And he makes it plain that we cannot choose who we become one body with when sex is involved.  When we choose sex, we also as a consequence, whether intended or not, become bonded with that partner.  Becoming one flesh with different women through sex is sexual immorality.  And every woman that we have sex also creates a bond with that woman.  This is the case whether it is a girlfriend from our past that we had a long relationship with to a one night stand after a party, or literally a paid encounter with a prostitute.  These covenants that we made where the intention was not marriage, but our own pleasure are called unholy covenants and represent unhealthy bonding. And it is these types of covenants that open the door to the enemy.\nThese bonds can easily be validated in the mind.  Have you ever been out somewhere familiar and that place triggered a memory of a woman that you have been with sexually in the past?  Or has a sexual event from your past appeared to your mind visually out of nowhere?  Or have you ever had a dream where you were taken back to a moment with a woman from your past or a woman that you have lusted after?",

Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never! Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, \"The two will become one flesh.\" But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit. Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price.

I realized that every woman that I had sex with actually put distance between me and God.  Actually God is the immovable object, but we, ourselves, pull farther away.  Do you want to really draw closer to God?  An important part of that directional move is to offer your body as a living sacrifice to Him.  Submit your members (your penis) to Him, and use it only under the parameters that he deemed holy and pleasing to Him.\nLet’s also broaden the idea of sex by using a snippet from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount which preached, “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’  But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ” (Matthew 5:27-28 NKJV).  Furthermore, Job 31:1-4 (MSG) says, “I made a solemn pact with myself never to undress a girl with my eyes. So what can I expect from God? What do I deserve from God Almighty above?  Isn’t calamity reserved for the wicked? Isn’t disaster supposed to strike those who do wrong? Isn’t God looking, observing how I live? Doesn’t he mark every step I take?” Both make it clear that while the sin is full grown under the act of fornication or adultery, sexual sin is first conceived at the point of lust.  Ask David what happened when he saw Bathsheba bathing on that rooftop! To be thorough, I want you to conclude that everything from lust of the eyes to the physical act of sexual intercourse, and every sexual encounter that falls short of intercourse should be included in unhealthy bonding.  This includes but is not limited to lusting after a woman that you could not have sex with, receiving or giving oral sex, engaging in pornography, frequenting strip clubs, being molested, having sex with a woman whose name that you cannot remember, and having sex with women whose names you can remember.\nOne topic that comes up consistently is to or not to masturbate.  Let me add this for those who need an extra push.  You are right, the topic of masturbation cannot be found anywhere in the Bible.  The closest we have is the Onan, the son of Judah, spilling his seed on the ground because he did not want to have children with Tamar.  Because of this lack of mention of masturbation as sin in the Bible, some men have argued that it is ok to masturbate.  So let us say that you are able to masturbate without the help of a physical interaction with a woman that is not your wife, without the help of pornography, or without the help of fantasizing about a woman, have you ever been able to masturbate and pray to your God thereafter? No.  And that is because masturbation alone brings shame and causes you to hide from God.  Anything that causes you to turn from God in your life should be avoided.",

This list is for you, but it will be something that we will use for tomorrow’s devotional.\nAnd make note of all the activity in your dreams this week.\nIf you have concerns, take a peak at Week 2, Day 5 now.  The purpose is to pray to break the soul tie that you have with these past women under the blood of our saviour and king Jesus Christ.",

Please forgive me God.  I renounce the relationship before you.  Please break any soul ties I may have with _______ in the name of Jesus Christ.  I release her in your Holy name.\nPlease bring to my remembrance any and everyone that I need to break soul ties with.  LORD God I wish to be free for my covenant wife.  *REPEAT\n\nEXAMPLE\nLord God, I repent for my sin with Jessica.  Please forgive me God.  I renounce the relationship before you.  Please break any soul ties I may have with Jessica in the name of Jesus Christ.  I release her in your Holy name.\nPlease bring to my remembrance any and everyone that I need to break soul ties with.  LORD God I wish to be free for my covenant wife.  *REPEAT\n\nIt seems so simple.  I get it.  The gift of Jesus Christ is simple and attainable by all who believe.  You have already said that you believe in Him before we started this Clean journey.  Stand on His promise in his Holy Name.  He can and will free you from your past.  Stand on it.  Pray and release your past so you can get out of the land of Egypt and/or the wilderness and into your Promised Land.\nBut wait, these prayers will really free you from the past.  These past memories will begin to dissipate from your mind.  Your escapes into these fantasies will be harder to get to and in some cases will be completely gone from your memory.  Are you ready for that leap?  If you marry, your wife is all that you will be able to rely on for your sexual needs.  This is the way that God designed it.\nFinally, this prayer is short so you can do it anywhere and everywhere.  When fantasies of other women come into your mind, you should break that soul tie immediately.  Don’t wait.  Do it on the spot.  Capture the thought and cast it down immediately.",

    "devotionText": "My brother, how is the assignment going?  Keep going.  Continue to ask the Holy Spirit to reveal those soul ties that you may have missed.  Be obedient and break those soul ties as they come to your remembrance.  Do not relish in the past, just release it in Jesus’ name.\nOne thing that I have experienced personally and have heard through the testimonies of many of the brothers like you who have moved through the Clean process is attacks in the dream state.  You may have already experienced this prior to Clean.  While sleeping, you may experience a dream where you are offered sex or find yourself in a sexually compromising situation.  Young boys colloquially called these wet dreams.  They are similar, but in order to clear up the misunderstanding around these types of dreams, let me explain.  This temptation is not from God.  These dreams are demonic attacks from the enemy and one must resist them.  I know, this is weird, and this might be the first time you are hearing about something like this.  I get it.  But listen.  Through the breaking of soul ties, you are cleaning up your past through the cleansing blood of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  And this act in and of itself is going to alert the enemy.  You were complicit in sexual disobedience, and the enemy is trying to make sure that he doesn’t lose one of his best members.\nThe key is that the fight against sexual disobedience must not only happen in the physical realm, but all seeds must be killed at the conception stage wherever they appear, including the dream state.  You have to fight the enemy on all levels.  If you are faced with a sexual proposition in your dream, you say no!  You resist, You run.  You get out of there.  And if worse comes to worse and you find yourself succumbing to the proposition then you WAKE UP!  There is no shame in that.  And even if you do fall during the dream, you pray, you repent, and you fight again the next time.  Don’t give up!    And finally, if you experience sleep paralysis or torment or any other demonic attack, you cry out--whether audibly or inaudibly--the name Jesus Christ.  The name above every name will set you free.\nAnd remember “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.” (1 Corinthians 10:13)",

        "text": "Blessed is the man who endures tempation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. Let no one say when he is tempted, \"I am tempted by God\"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death."
