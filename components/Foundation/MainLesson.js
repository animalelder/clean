        My brother, the definition of sanctify is to be set apart as holy. Saul
        had to be called out into the open by Samuel to be set apart for God.
        Our Lord Jesus Christ called Simon and Andrew from the boat and set them
        apart for himself in service of His kingdom. Moses was called by his
        curiosity of the burning bush to be set apart for God.

        then you too, like me, have been called and set apart by God. This is
        the beginning of the sanctification process. Welcome! Like Saul, Simon
        and Andrew, Moses, and Paul (Saul) and Barnabas from these scriptures,
        this is the beginning of the journey to be set apart and used by God in
        the way that He designed you Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
