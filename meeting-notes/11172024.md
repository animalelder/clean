## Hot Topics

Will's been thinking about how to do the daily survey; there are 18 items on the daily survey; so that'd make 82 possible options.

Wanted to think through these daily surveys: its a lot of content in a small space; thinking to move this to a modal that pops up when a user first logs into a system.

## Parsing data from Word Doc

We can use MDX components for the content of the word doc; and have a template for how to render each lesson.

Could make an admin page that allows admins to make a folder and edit text templates to create new courses, and then those folders are added to the code base.

We could turn `MainLesson.js` as a template, and make each day of the program a different MDX file.

Either way, we could store the lesson text on the server, even if we didn't use MDX, and could use the URL query params to get the different content, because the text changes but the style of the page stays the same.

We'd only need one page for this setup.

Should track which day the user is on in the database; and we can conditionally render based on that date.

Will take some refactoring and shifting, but this should be ok. we'll need to use the dynamic routes in next js: <https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes>

## Usage Estimates

These calculations outline requirements for server architecture, database scaling, caching, and content delivery at different user levels. Efficient caching, CDN use, and database optimization become essential as user scale and traffic demand increase.

Will need to start thinking about load balancers here and the ability to scale here; with the amount of payment. Should consider cloud based DBs to only be charged for the usage.

Maybe we use MongoDB's Atlas and GraphQL API to grab data. There's always a way to do things depending on the tools.

How would we be serving the app? should it be a static side thing with client side javascript, or the way next is with a server and then cache them. The way we do the logic, we'll need to think through this.

Will is cool with doing the API gateway and a lambda function.

- Vercel for Deployment; watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsuNjCAngnQ)
  - poor design can create a big bill; need to avoid this.
- Nextjs has a built in cache
- using reactQuery caches things automatically too
  - using fetch or axios to do requests, but ReactQuery helps with caching and optimization.
- can use Gitlab CI for deploying to Vercel
- MongoDB Atlas for DB
- GraphQL API in AWS with API Gateway and Lambda function
- Clerk for Authentication

We could use pre-signed URLs to reference content in an S3 bucket, and we'd want to add a CDN to the S3 bucket; could use other options besides CDNs. All the user stuff can go to a different CDN; the lessons stuff can go to a different CDNs too, that way we can reduce traffic a lot.

There's a CDN that's free up to 2 GB of storage, but they don't charge for uploads and downloads; and you pay for space after the 2 GBs, with unlimited data transfer.

- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/pricing) seems like a good CDN for video because it automatically provides the right type of streaming quality to the user.
- [uploadthing](https://uploadthing.com/)
- [bunny cdn](https://bunny.net/cdn/)
- [appwrite](https://appwrite.io/pricing) -- this would also be linked up with the database with little effort; and we could possibly use a graphQL API in their docs.

We can kind of wire these services together.

## For filtering on API endpoints

**REMEMBER**: The filtering of the content can happen on the page instead of having to call the database again.

## Slow Site

The next Link Component pre-renders the page you are rendering; so that's why its kind of slow.

use `router.push` instead.

# To Do

- talk to donovan about survey's being a modal
- using MDX components for foundation.
- Work through all the individual actions in the API design section of Excalidraw
- fix fonts on foundation page
- Fix bullet 5 in side panel.
