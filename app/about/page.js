              CLEAN exists to help men find freedom, purpose, and brotherhood.
              We believe that every man has the potential to live a life of
              integrity and impact, but too often, struggles with sexual sin and
              lack of purpose hold men back from becoming who God created them
              to be.

                  To help men discover and step into their God-given purpose. We
                  believe that once men gain self-control in this vital area,
                  they open the door for God to reveal their true purpose. If
                  purpose is like a white suit, God will not hand it to you
                  while you&apos;re living in the mud of sin. CLEAN helps men
                  get out of the mud so they can walk in the fullness of the
                  life God has prepared for them.

              sexual sin and betrayal trauma with grace and truth.
